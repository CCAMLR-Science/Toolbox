This package was developed to simplify the production of maps in the
CAMLR Convention Area. It provides two main categories of functions:
load functions and create functions. Load functions are used to import
spatial layers from the online [CCAMLR GIS](https://gis.ccamlr.org/)
such as the ASD boundaries. Create functions are used to create layers
from user data such as polygons and grids.

## Installation

You can install the CCAMLRGIS R package from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("CCAMLRGIS")
```
