# Seabed area estimation â€“ an example in Subarea 48.6

Estimating planimetric seabed area (*i.e.*, the area between two
isobaths) is a common task in CCAMLR works (*e.g.*, in the [Trend
Analysis](https://fishdocs.ccamlr.org/TrendAnalysis_2024.html)). The R
script linked below provides an example in which seabed area is
estimated for the entire Subarea 48.6 and its Research Blocks (Fig. 1).

[**Download R script**](./Codes/Seabed_Area/seabed_area_code.R).

## Steps

1.  Create a folder, a new R project in that folder, and put the R
    script in that folder,

2.  Download the un-projected bathymetry from here (*link to come*),

3.  Run the script. A csv file should have been created in your folder.
