# Seabed area estimation -- an example in Subarea 48.6

Estimating planimetric seabed area (*i.e.*, the area between two isobaths) is a common
task in CCAMLR works (*e.g.*, in the [Trend Analysis](https://fishdocs.ccamlr.org/TrendAnalysis_2024.html)).
The R script linked below provides an example in which seabed area is estimated for the entire Subarea 48.6 
and its Research Blocks (Fig. 1).

## Steps

1. Create a folder, a new R project in that folder, and put the R script in that folder,

2. Download the un-projected bathymetry from here (*link to come*),

3. Run the script. A csv file should have been created in your folder (Table 1).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Tab=read.csv("./Codes/Seabed_Area/FishArea.csv")
kableExtra::kable(Tab,row.names = F)
```
